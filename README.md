# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This is a Prework Study Guide to allow me to learn my baseline skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my UCF Bootcamp Class. This will also allow me to have a resource to look back to and add new notes throughout my course. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
